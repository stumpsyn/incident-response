# Incident Response Training Outline

## Overview of a good code of conduct

*Resources: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Code_of_conduct_evaluations*

* Why have one?
    * To have a visible policy in place before an incident occurs
    * To let it be known that there will be consequences to violations
    * To let speakers, attendees, sponsors, and anyone else within a community know that there is an expectation of maintaining a certain level of professional conduct at all times related to the event, including before/during/after, and in related communications
* What is its purpose?
    * To help marginalized people feel welcome
    * To provide a guideline for action when (not if) incidents occur
    * To demonstrate the scope of the policy
    * To document potential interventions
* What does it look like?
    * Include specific examples of inappropriate behavior
    * Roleplay exercise in finding where peopleâ€™s comfort zone/personal space is.

## How to decrease the risk of an incident

*Resources: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Higher_risk_activities*

* Be visible in person and online
    * Consider wearing a signifier that you are someone who can be approached in-person for things like this
    * Have dedicated operators for IRC channel(s)
    * Have moderation for group's comments/posts
* Make your code of conduct visible in person and online
    * Put it prominently on your website
    * Consider linking to it in the details of every gathering
    * Mention it at the opening of every meeting
    * Consider having a copy on hand

## What is an incident?

* Anatomy of a code of conduct violation
    * Some says something offensive, sexist, racist, homophobic or transphobic, body-shaming, etc that makes someone else uncomfortable enough to feel unsafe or like they were verbally attacked.
    * Someone says something that is violent in nature against other people.
    * Someone says something incredibly harassing in nature.
    * Someone will not stop following another person, to the point of them fearing for their safety.
    * Someone makes physical or sexual advances and doesn't stop when told no, or wasn't given permission to have contact in that way in the first place.

## How to take a report

*Would be awesome to have a sample reporting form*

* When someone makes a report
* When something happens publicly
* When you find out about it after the fact

## How to respond to an incident or report

*Would be awesome to have sample reporting guidelines and response templates for first contact with a reporter, final report, responding to reporter*

* Consider implementing reporting guidelines
* As much as possible, involve another incident response person
* In person
    * Take any necessary action to mitigate immediate safety risks
    * Give the reporter whatever they need to feel more secure and comfortable
      * Private space to be alone, to bring a friend with them while they make a  report, food or water, etc.
* Over email
    * Take any necessary action to mitigate immediate safety risks
    * Acknowledge receipt
