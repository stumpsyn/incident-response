# Incident Response Training

## Purpose of this group

The purpose of the Incident Response Training Team is to help organizational leaders effectively build and maintain safer communities by training them to respond to violent or marginalizing incidents within their spaces.

[Stumptown Syndicate](http://stumptownsyndicate.org/) has convened the Incident Response Training Team to create and implement this training.

## About the training

The Incident Response Training Team is actively in the process of creating this training with the goal of running a beta version of the full training June 26th, 2015 at [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/). If you would like to attend, please email shawnatyger@gmail.com.
